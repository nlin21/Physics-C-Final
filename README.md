# PhysicsCFinal
Final project for Physics C class

This is an interactive simulation of one-bob pendulum and two-bob pendulum systems.

The following variables can be changed (along witht their ranges):
- Number of pendulum bobs (1-2 bobs)
- Length of pendulum string (25-200 pixels)
- Mass of pendulum bobs (10-50 units)
- Gravity (0.5-1.0, higher means stronger gravity)
- Dampening (0.95-1.00, higher means less dampening)
